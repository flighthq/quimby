// Orders the versions snapshot-version.ts produces, so a publish can refuse to drag a dist-tag
// backwards.
//
// A dist-tag is a mutable pointer, and `npm publish --tag next` moves it to whatever it just
// published — npm offers no publish-without-setting-a-tag. So when two builds for different commits
// reach the publish step out of commit order (their CI legs finish out of order, which the publish
// job's concurrency group serializes but does not order), the older one would point `next` at an
// older snapshot. Skipping it loses nothing: main is linear and `count` is monotonic, so the newer
// snapshot already on the tag contains the older commit's work.
//
// Deliberately narrow rather than a general semver implementation. It understands exactly the two
// shapes this repo publishes — `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` for a stable release and
// `<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<channel>.<count>.<sha>` for a snapshot — and treats ANYTHING it cannot
// parse as "not superseded". That direction is the safe one: a wrong `false` merely publishes,
// which is the pre-guard behavior, whereas a wrong `true` silently drops a snapshot AND leaves the
// tag stale.
